🧠 What is the KK2.1.5/KK2 Controller?
The KK2 board is an open-source, budget-friendly flight controller for multirotors. It uses an Atmega644PA microcontroller and an LCD screen for in-field setup—no laptop needed (hello, ease of use ✨). It handles stabilization (via gyroscope + accelerometer) and sends motor outputs based on input from your RC transmitter.

## 🧩 **Main Components of a Drone**

### 1. **Flight Controller (FC)** – *The Brain 🧠*

* Processes sensor data (gyro, accelerometer).
* Stabilizes and controls the drone.
* Examples: **KK2**, **Pixhawk**, **Betaflight**, **Naza**, **APM**.

---

### 2. **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)** – *The Muscle Connector 💪*

* Translates signals from the flight controller into high-power signals for motors.
* Usually 4 for a quadcopter (1 per motor).
* Types: BLHeli, SimonK, DShot (faster protocols = smoother flight).

---

### 3. **Brushless Motors** – *The Prop Spinners 🌀*

* Provide thrust.
* Rated in **KV** (RPM per volt). E.g., 2300KV spins faster than 1000KV.

---

### 4. **Propellers** – *The Wings (Sorta) 🍃*

* 2-blade or 3-blade.
* Size and pitch affect lift and speed.
* Props must match motor direction (CW/CCW).

---

### 5. **Battery (LiPo)** – *The Juice 🔋*

* Usually 3S (11.1V), 4S (14.8V), or 6S (22.2V) **LiPo** batteries.
* Choose based on flight time vs. weight.
* Needs a **LiPo charger** and you better *not* short it.

---

### 6. **Receiver (Rx)** – *The Listener 🎧*

* Connects to your transmitter (radio controller).
* Receives pilot inputs and sends them to FC.
* Protocols: PWM, PPM, SBUS, iBUS.

---

### 7. **Transmitter (Tx)** – *The Pilot's Joystick 🎮*

* Your hand-held controller.
* Usually 6 to 10 channels.
* Brands: FlySky, FrSky, Radiomaster.

---

### 8. **Frame** – *The Skeleton 🦴*

* Holds everything together.
* Materials: carbon fiber (light + strong), plastic (cheap), aluminum (heavy).
* Types: X-frame, H-frame, deadcat, etc.

---

### 9. **GPS Module (Optional)** – *The Navigator 🧭*

* Needed for autonomous flight, position hold, return-to-home.
* Used in Pixhawk, APM, iNav systems.

---

### 10. **Telemetry Module (Optional)** – *The Chatterbox 📡*

* Sends live data to your laptop or ground station.
* Common protocols: MAVLink, FrSky SmartPort.

---

### 11. **Camera & VTX (FPV Only)** – *The Drone’s Eye 🎥*

* For First Person View flying.
* Camera sends live video to goggles via **VTX** (video transmitter).
* Use **5.8 GHz** antennas for FPV.

---

### 12. **Buzzer (Optional but 🔥 useful)** – *The Screamer 🔊*

* Beeps when drone is lost.
* Also used for low battery warning or crash detection.

---

## 🛸 Bonus: If It’s Autonomous...

* Add: **Ultrasonic sensors**, **LiDAR**, **barometer**, **compass**, **optical flow**, **Raspberry Pi/Jetson Nano** for AI brainpower 🧠
